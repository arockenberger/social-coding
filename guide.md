# Instructor guide for Social Science

## Basics

This is basically presented as-is - not much technical presentation is
needed.

There are three main acts:

- Emphasis of the concept of derivative work and that everything is
  based on other things.  And if your goal is citations, you want as
  many people using your work as possible, because then they can cite
  you.

- A bit of details on free software and choosing a license (the least
  important part)... there are other online resources, and the biggest
  question is permissive vs viral.

- A final act on how just licensing isn't enough.  If you want people
  to use your work, you need to do more to make your work easily
  reusable.  Use this as an entry point to tell people what is coming
  up in the rest of CodeRefinery (if this talk is on day 1) or
  re-emphasize how past lessons all fit together (if on the last
  day).

## Hints

In the source code, in HTML comments, are various hints and stories
you can give.  These can help to motivate reasons to license.
Especially note the ones about
- why this is called Social Science, not Software Licensing
- the one about IBM software.

Before you begin, it's worth thinking about some particular good or
bad cases you know about from your experience.
- When have you lost access or not been able to use something because
  licensing wasn't handled well.
- When did multiple ownership mess up your plans?


This talk used to be called "software licensing".  You could mention
that to make it more interesting, we have adopted the current broader
name, and our emphasis is not just licensing, but why licensing is
needed.

Don't emphasize the different forms of intellectual property that
much - you should go quickly through that section.  The main point is
to be able to say that copyright is not the only form of protection,
and not one that you must keep to yourself.
